## **Project Details: Image-to-Image Translation with GANs**

### **Topic: Image Style Transfer or Data Augmentation**

- **Goal:** To train a CycleGan model to perform image-to-image translation, such as converting day-to-night images, sketches-to-real images, or augmenting datasets with synthetic images.
- **Implementation:**
    - Use a dataset like Cityscapes for day-to-night translation or a custom dataset.
    - Train a GAN with generator-discriminator adversarial loss.
- **Learning Outcome:** Understanding GAN architectures, image synthesis, and model evaluation.
- **Stretch Goal:** Generate synthetic training data to boost performance in other tasks.
